"""Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (Phase 2, P2.2).

Partition the trade series into ``N`` time-ordered groups; for every combination
of ``k`` test groups (``C(N,k)`` of them) pool the out-of-sample returns and score
their Sharpe. The distribution of those path-Sharpes is what the kill-gate judges:
narrow & positive = robust; wild variance = fragile (Part III Layer 2). The number
of reconstructed paths is ``phi = C(N,k)·k/N``.

**Purging & embargo.** Each combination's pooled test trades are purged of any
observation whose label window overlaps a *train* group's span, and a further
embargo buffer (default one trading day) is applied at the test/train boundary —
both via the single shared :func:`~lab.research.validation.splitter.purge_indices`
primitive (also used by the purged k-fold splitter and CSCV/PBO), so their purge
semantics cannot drift apart. For a single
symbol whose intraday positions square off within the session, trades are
sequential and rarely overlap, so the embargo buffer is the active guard, thinning
the pool near boundaries; with concurrent/overlapping labels the overlap purge also
bites. (Deterministic rules do no per-fold fitting, so full-coverage reconstructed
paths would be identical — hence the distribution is taken over the purged
``C(N,k)`` test-group combinations, not those degenerate paths.)
